# Crowded_Market_Analysis

This project aims to report on a weekly basis the positioning of market participants on the US most liquid futures contracts. 
The Python code I developped scrappes the data disclosed by the CFTC on a weekly basis.

The final goal of this analysis is to detect 'crowded positioning' from large speculators that are suspect to liquid thier positions in case of the end of a trend or a newsfailure that make them lose money.
